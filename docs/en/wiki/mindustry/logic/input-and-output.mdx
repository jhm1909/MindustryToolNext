# Input and Output Instructions

Mindustry Logic provides various input and output instructions that allow scripts to read data, modify memory, draw graphics, and display text. This page covers `read`, `write`, `draw`, and `print`, explaining their purpose and providing examples.

## read

The `read` instruction retrieves a value from a memory cell.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
read [variable] [memoryCell] [index]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
read data memory1 0
print data
print flush
```

**Explanation:** This script reads the value stored at index `0` of `memory1` and prints it.

## write

The `write` instruction stores a value in a memory cell at a specific index.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
write [value] [memoryCell] [index]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
write 42 memory1 0
read data memory1 0
print data
print flush
```

**Explanation:** This script stores `42` at index `0` in `memory1`, then reads and prints the value.

## draw

The `draw` instruction is used to render shapes and text onto a display.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
draw [command] [param1] [param2] [param3] [param4]
draw flush
```

### Example (Drawing a Rectangle):

```plaintext
draw color 255 0 0 255
draw rect 10 10 50 50
draw flush
```

**Explanation:** This script sets the draw color to red, draws a rectangle at (10,10) with a size of 50x50, and flushes the drawing commands to render them on the display.

## print

The `print` instruction outputs text to the display or console.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
print [text]
print flush
```

### Example:

```plaintext
print "Hello, World!"
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script prints "Hello, World!" to the console or linked display.

## Conclusion

- Use `read` to retrieve data from memory cells.
- Use `write` to store data in memory cells.
- Use `draw` to create visual elements on a display.
- Use `print` to output text information.

By mastering these instructions, you can create efficient Mindustry Logic scripts for automation and visualization.
