# Control Flow Instructions

Mindustry Logic provides various control flow instructions that allow scripts to manage execution flow efficiently. This page covers `end`, `stop`, `wait`, and `jump`, explaining their purpose and providing examples.

## `end`

The `end` instruction immediately stops script execution. It is typically used to terminate the program explicitly.

### Example:

```plaintext
print "Start"
end
print "This will not be executed"
```

**Explanation:** The script prints "Start", but after `end` is executed, all further instructions are ignored.

## `stop`

The `stop` instruction halts execution but allows the script to restart in the next logic tick. It is useful for looping scripts that need periodic execution without consuming excessive processing power.

### Example:

```plaintext
print "Running"
stop
print "This will execute in the next tick"
```

**Explanation:** The script prints "Running", then halts at `stop`. On the next logic tick, execution resumes at the next instruction.

## `wait`

The `wait` instruction pauses execution for a specified number of logic ticks before continuing. This is useful for timing operations.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
wait [ticks]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
print "Start"
wait 60
print "This prints after 60 ticks"
```

**Explanation:** The script prints "Start", then pauses for 60 logic ticks before executing the next instruction.

## `jump`

The `jump` instruction moves execution to a specific line in the script based on a condition. It is useful for creating loops and conditional execution.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
jump [line] [condition]
```

### Example (Looping Counter):

```plaintext
set counter 0
:loop
print counter
op add counter counter 1
jump loop lessThan counter 5
```

**Explanation:** This script initializes `counter` to 0, prints it, increments it, and jumps back to the `loop` label until `counter` reaches 5.

## Conclusion

- Use `end` to terminate scripts immediately.
- Use `stop` to pause execution until the next logic tick.
- Use `wait` to introduce delays between instructions.
- Use `jump` to control execution flow conditionally or create loops.

By mastering these instructions, you can write efficient Mindustry Logic scripts for automation and control systems.
