# Understanding Variables in Mindustry Logic

## Basics of Variables

Variables in Mindustry Logic are used to store and manipulate data during script execution. They allow for dynamic control of logic-based automation, such as tracking values, making calculations, and controlling flow.

### Key Features:

- Variables are stored in processor memory.
- They can hold numbers, block states, or unit properties.
- Values are updated dynamically as the script runs.
- Variables can be used in conditional checks, loops, and arithmetic operations.

## How to Use Variables

You can create and assign values to variables using the `set` command:

```plaintext
set myVar 10
```

This assigns the value `10` to `myVar`.

Variables can also store sensor data:

```plaintext
sensor coreHealth core health
```

This stores the core’s health in the variable `coreHealth`.

## Special Variables

Mindustry Logic has some special variables that hold important game data:

- **`@counter`** → Stores the current loop iteration count.
- **`@tick`** → Stores the number of game ticks since the processor started.
- **`@time`** → Stores the total time elapsed in the game.
- **`@unit`** → Stores the currently controlled unit.
- **`@this`** → Refers to the processor itself.
- **`@mapw`** → Stores the width of the map.
- **`@maph`** → Stores the height of the map.

## Use Cases

Variables are essential for:

- **Tracking Resources**: Store values for power, items, or liquids.
- **Unit Control**: Keep track of unit coordinates and states.
- **Automation**: Store calculations for efficient production.
- **Conditional Logic**: Compare values and execute actions accordingly.

## Examples

### Example 1: Counting Loops

```plaintext
set counter 0
label loop
    print counter
    op add counter counter 1
    jump loop lessThan counter 5
```

This script prints numbers from 0 to 4 and stops.

### Example 2: Checking Core Health

```plaintext
sensor health core health
print health
```

This continuously monitors and prints the core’s health.

### Example 3: Controlling Units

```plaintext
sensor x @unit x
sensor y @unit y
op add x x 10
ucontrol move x y
```

This moves the unit 10 tiles to the right.
