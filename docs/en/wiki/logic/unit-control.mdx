# Unit Control Instructions

Mindustry Logic provides various unit control instructions that allow scripts to command and manage units efficiently. This page covers `unit bind`, `unit control`, `unit radar`, and `unit locate`, explaining their purpose and providing examples.

## unit bind

The `unit bind` instruction binds a unit to the script, allowing control over it.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
unit bind [unit]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
unit bind @flare
print "Unit bound!"
print flush
```

**Explanation:** This script binds a `flare` unit to the script, allowing it to be controlled.

## unit control

The `unit control` instruction issues commands to the bound unit, such as moving, attacking, or boosting.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
unit control [command] [param1] [param2] [param3] [param4]
```

### Example (Move to Position):

```plaintext
unit control move 100 100 0 0
```

**Explanation:** The script commands the bound unit to move to coordinates (100,100).

### Example (Attack Enemy):

```plaintext
unit control attack 200 200 1 0
```

**Explanation:** The script commands the unit to attack at coordinates (200,200) with priority enabled.

## unit radar

The `unit radar` instruction scans for units based on criteria such as team and distance.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
unit radar [sort] [team] [type] [outputVariable]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
unit radar closest enemy any target
print target
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script scans for the closest enemy unit and stores the result in `target`, which is then printed.

## unit locate

The `unit locate` instruction finds the closest core, spawn, or enemy.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
unit locate [target] [outputX] [outputY] [foundVariable]
```

### Example (Locate Nearest Core):

```plaintext
unit locate core coreX coreY found
print coreX
print coreY
print found
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script finds the nearest core, storing its coordinates in `coreX` and `coreY`. The `found` variable indicates if a core was located.

## Conclusion

- Use `unit bind` to bind a unit for control.
- Use `unit control` to issue commands to the bound unit.
- Use `unit radar` to detect nearby units based on criteria.
- Use `unit locate` to find strategic locations such as cores and enemies.

By mastering these instructions, you can create efficient unit automation scripts in Mindustry Logic.
