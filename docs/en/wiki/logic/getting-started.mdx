# Beginner's Guide

## Introduction

Mindustry Logic (ML) is a built-in programming system that allows players to automate tasks using processors, memory cells, and linked structures. It functions like an assembly-style language, enabling automation of unit control, factory management, defense mechanisms, and resource distribution.

## Basic Components

Mindustry Logic operates using several key components:

- **Processors**: The core execution units that run logic scripts.
- **Memory Cells**: Used to store and retrieve data persistently.
- **Links**: Allow processors to interact with buildings, units, and resources.
- **Variables**: Temporary data storage for calculations and control logic.

## Flow of Execution

Mindustry Logic executes commands sequentially, line by line. It supports loops and conditional jumps to create complex behaviors. The general flow follows:

1. **Reading Data**: Sensors retrieve information from linked buildings or units.
2. **Processing Data**: Arithmetic operations and conditional checks determine the next steps.
3. **Controlling Blocks/Units**: Commands are issued to blocks or units based on processed data.
4. **Repeating or Ending Execution**: Execution loops until conditions are met or the script stops.

## Basic Commands

Some fundamental commands include:

- `set var value` → Assigns a value to a variable.
- `op operation result a b` → Performs arithmetic operations (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, etc.).
- `print "text"` → Displays text in the processor’s console.
- `end` → Terminates script execution.

## Control Flow

Control flow determines how a script proceeds based on conditions. Key commands:

- `jump label` → Jumps to a predefined label.
- `jump label condition a b` → Conditional jump if `a` and `b` satisfy the condition (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
- `label myLabel` → Defines a point in the script for jumps.

### Example: Basic Loop

```js
set counter 0
label loop
    print counter
    op add counter counter 1
    jump loop lessThan counter 10
```

This loop prints numbers from 0 to 9 and stops when `counter` reaches 10.

## Interacting with Blocks

Processors can interact with blocks using sensors and commands.

- `sensor var block property` → Reads block data (e.g., `sensor power storage powerNetStored`).
- `setblock x y type` → Places a block at the specified coordinates.
- `getlink index var` → Retrieves a linked block.

### Example: Checking Core Health

```js
sensor coreHealth core health
print coreHealth
jump loop
```

This script prints the core’s health in a continuous loop.

## Interacting with Units

Processors can control units to move, attack, and gather resources.

- `ulocate mode x y var` → Finds the nearest unit in a specified mode (`enemy`, `ally`, `ore`).
- `ucontrol command` → Issues a command to a unit (e.g., `move x y`, `mine x y`).

### Example: Moving a Unit to (100, 200)

```js
ucontrol move 100 200
```

## Practical Applications

Mindustry Logic is useful for various tasks, including:

- **Factory Automation**: Automate supply chains by managing conveyor belts and factories.
- **Turret Targeting**: Optimize turret control to prioritize specific enemies.
- **Unit AI**: Command units for mining, defending, or attacking.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Automatically check and redistribute resources.

By mastering Mindustry Logic, players can significantly enhance their base efficiency and defense automation. Start experimenting with processors today to build advanced logic-driven strategies!
