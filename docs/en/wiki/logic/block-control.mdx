# Block Control Instructions

Mindustry Logic provides various block control instructions that allow scripts to interact with the game world efficiently. This page covers `draw flush`, `print flush`, `get link`, `sensor`, `control`, and `radar`, explaining their purpose and providing examples.

## `draw flush`

The `draw flush` instruction commits all previously issued draw operations to the screen. Without this, drawing commands will not be rendered until the script stops or reaches a flush point.

### Example:

```plaintext
draw color 255 0 0 255
draw rect 10 10 50 50
draw flush
```

**Explanation:** This script sets the draw color to red, draws a rectangle at (10,10) with a size of 50x50, and then flushes the drawing commands to render them on the display.

## `print flush`

The `print flush` instruction commits all `print` commands to the message display or linked terminal block.

### Example:

```plaintext
print "Hello, World!"
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script queues "Hello, World!" and then flushes it, ensuring it is displayed on the linked display or message block.

## `get link`

The `get link` instruction assigns a linked block to a variable for interaction.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
get link [variable] [index]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
get link core 1
print core
```

**Explanation:** The script links the block at index 1 to the variable `core` and prints its reference.

## `sensor`

The `sensor` instruction retrieves data from a block or unit.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
sensor [variable] [target] [property]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
sensor health core1 @health
print health
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script retrieves the `health` of the block stored in `core1` and prints the value.

## `control`

The `control` instruction sends commands to blocks such as turrets or units.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
control [block] [command] [param1] [param2] [param3]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
control turret shoot 100 100 1
```

**Explanation:** The script commands a turret to shoot at coordinates (100,100) with a shooting power of 1.

## `radar`

The `radar` instruction scans for enemy units based on given parameters.

### Syntax:

```plaintext
radar [sort] [target] [filter] [outputVariable]
```

### Example:

```plaintext
radar closest enemy any target
print target
print flush
```

**Explanation:** The script scans for the closest enemy unit and stores the result in `target`, which is then printed.

## Conclusion

- Use `draw flush` to finalize drawing commands.
- Use `print flush` to finalize print operations.
- Use `get link` to interact with specific blocks.
- Use `sensor` to retrieve block or unit data.
- Use `control` to send commands to units or turrets.
- Use `radar` to detect enemy units.

By mastering these instructions, you can create efficient automation scripts in Mindustry Logic.
